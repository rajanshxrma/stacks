"""Local, on-disk semantic index -- the on-device replacement for
finance-rag's Supabase pgvector table.

Brute-force cosine similarity over numpy arrays, not a real vector database
(faiss/chroma/hnswlib) -- deliberate, not a corner cut: this indexes a
person's own files (thousands, not millions, of chunks), and numpy handles
that scale in well under a second (measured, see eval script). Reaching for
a real ANN index would add a real dependency and real complexity for a
speed problem that doesn't exist at this scale.

Stored at ~/.stacks/index.json by default, outside the repo (also
git-ignored as a second safeguard, see .gitignore) and created with 0600
permissions -- this file contains real snippets of the user's own
documents, so it gets the same "not world-readable" treatment as an SSH key,
not left at default umask permissions.
